Technology Help us or Make us Helpless 


It’s two side of the coin. It’s difficult to understand. Technology is like a bad master-good servant thing. It can help us but if we cross the limit. It can be dangerous. So make a presentation on the faint line between the two. Of course, you can share the difference between life quality before and after technology advancements to prove your point right.

Tech enables us to do more while understanding less. That’s fine, until there’s a glitch (bhul)

Technology plays an important role in our life. Technology can save or waste your time; it all depends on how we use it. Nowadays people can’t imagine their life without technology, that can help them to live life in a better and easier way. Technology is now a big part of our society and our future.


Hello everyone Good evening, today I give presentation on Technolohy, Topic is: Technology Help us or Make us Helpless, (advantage and disadvante of technology)

Technology is like a bad master-good servant thing. It can help us but if we cross the limit, It can be dangerous to us.
Technology enables us to do more while understanding less. That's fine, until there is no mistake to use it.
Technology plays an important role in our life. Technology can save or waste your time; it all depends on how we use it.
Technology is at least partially responsible for the development of a loneliness epidemic,
dependence on new technology. Man no longer needs to think. Even if the calculator is a good invention, man no longer makes mental calculation and no longer works his memory.
