<b>What is PHP MVC framework?</b><br><br>

PHP MVC is an application design pattern that separates the application data and business logic (model) from the presentation (view). MVC stands for Model, View & Controller.

The controller mediates between the models and views.

Think of the MVC design pattern as a car and the driver.
<img src="<?php echo $baseurl;?>images/mvc.png" style="float:right; padding:10px; width: 350px; height: 300px;">
The car has the windscreens (view) which the driver (controller) uses to monitor traffic ahead then speed or brake (model) depending on what he sees ahead.<br><br>

<b>Why use PHP MVC Framework?</b><br><br>


PHP MVC Frameworks simplify working with complex technologies by;
    Hiding all the complex implementation details
    Providing standard methods that we can use to build our applications.
    Increased developer productivity, this is because the base implementation of activities such as connecting to the database, sanitizing user input etc. are already partially implemented.
    Adherence to professional coding standards
